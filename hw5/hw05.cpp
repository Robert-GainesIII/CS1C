    //1. What is the STL? What is a vector?
    //An stl is a standard template library data that includes Algorithms
    //Containers
    //Functions
    //Iterators
    //A Vector is like an array in that it stores linear information like an array but is resizable
    
    //2. Which vector operations change the size of a vector
    //after its construction?
    //push_back is the function used to increase the size dynamically of a vecotor
    
    //3.What should begin() and end() do for a container?
    //Begin should return the iterator to the beginning of the list
    //While end should return the iterator to the end of the list.
    
    //4. Give an example of using the vector push_back()
    // modifier.
    //myData.push_back(data);
